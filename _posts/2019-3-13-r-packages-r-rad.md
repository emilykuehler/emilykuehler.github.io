# BasketballStatsR: My First Non-Trivial R Package

## Project Goals

My love of data and the NBA naturally pushes me toward a lot of side projects involving basketball. These projects inevitably involve some sort of data retrieval and visualization. After scraping data from multiple sources, generally thinking about gathering in a way specific to whatever project I was doing, I decided to get organized and write a package that can gather the data I need and make some simple visualizations.

As it turns out, there is already a CRAN package, ([Alex Bresler's excellent nbastatR](http://asbcllc.com/nbastatR/)) so you may be asking why I am going through the somewhat masochistic motions of writing my own. 

* I wanted to add visualization features (i.e. the ability to create shot charts along these lines: <img src="/img/klayshotchart.jpeg" alt="klay" width="450"/>
